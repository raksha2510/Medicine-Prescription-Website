What is Lung cancer?
    </strong>
    <p> <br>
        Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs. When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases.

        </p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are the symptoms of lung cancer?</strong><br>
    <br>
        1.Coughing that gets worse or doesnâ€™t go away</br><br>

        2.Chest pain</br><br>
        
        3.Shortness of breath</br><br>
        
        4.Wheezing</br><br>
        
        5.Weight loss with no known cause</br>
        
        </p>
        <p><strong>What causes lung cancer?</strong></p>
        Smoking causes the majority of lung cancers both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke. But lung cancer also occurs in people who never smoked and in those who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke. In these cases, there may be no clear cause of lung cancer.

       
        <br>
<p><strong>
    What are the diagnosis and precautions to take at home?
    </strong></p>
    You and your doctor choose a cancer treatment plan based on a number of factors, such as your overall health, the type and stage of your cancer, and your preferences.
    In some cases, you may choose not to undergo treatment. For instance, you may feel that the side effects of treatment will outweigh the potential benefits. When that's the case, your doctor may suggest comfort care to treat only the symptoms the cancer is causing, such as pain or shortness of breath.
    
<p><strong>What are the prescribed medicines for lung cancer?</strong></p>
Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer:<br>
Afinitor (Everolimus):Everolimus is a targeted cancer drug that blocks cancer growth, its also known by its brand name Afinitor.</br><br>
Atezolizumab:Atezolizumab injection is used alone to help prevent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from coming back in patients whose tumor has been removed by surgery and who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum). </br>
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride:A drug that comes from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius and is used alone or with other drugs to treat many types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and certain cancers of the lung, breast, stomach, ovary, thyroid, and bladder.<br></br>
Durvalumab:Durvalumab injection is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has not spread and cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) and radiation treatment for their NSCLC.</br><br>
Etoposide:Etoposide is used in combination with other medications to treat a certain type of lung cancer (small cell lung cancer; SCLC). Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.</br>
